# Configuration file for mbsync.
#
# This file is a template for generic IMAP servers, and can be
# used with mbsync with the following example command:
#
# mbsync <user> -c <(USERNAME=<user> HOSTNAME=<host> envsubst < <conf>)
#
# Where <user> is something like "user@test.com" and host is something
# like "mail.test.com". This is assuming that a password is set for
# the above name in the `mail.sync.user <user>` key in Gnome-Keyring.
